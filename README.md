# MemoryGameCreatorJS

Creates a HTML file for printing out a memory game.

## How it works

Put all images for the memory cards into a folder. Copy the index.js file from the Git into the same folder. Call the index.js file in Node.js and you'll have a index.html - just open that file (in Chrome or Safari) and print it out.

## Options

Call `node index.js 400` for making a memory card 400px. Call just `node index.js` for creating the default value of 300px.
